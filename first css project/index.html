    <div class="image-kanye" class=""><img src="kanye.jpeg" alt="YEEEEEEE" class="kanye-img">Kanye Meme <br><p style="font-size: 12px;font-weight: lighter;">I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
        Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
        I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
        The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
        I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
        I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
        See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
        And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
        I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
        I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
        What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
        Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that would be so Kanye
        That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
        And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye </p></div>
